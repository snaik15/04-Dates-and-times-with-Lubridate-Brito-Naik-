# Working with Lubridate


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2022. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2022.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to working with date and time objects with R and the Lubridate package. Dates and times can be difficult to work with because of the many formats for such data, and the presence of time zones, daylight savings, and leap years. Lubridate provides functions that make it easy to work with dates and times so that you can easily analyse such data.  

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) equip you with conceptual knowledge about the Lubridate package and working with dates and times, (2) show you the main functions you can use from the pacakge, and (3) provide you with practice material as well as some further readings.
